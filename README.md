# optimal-taxation

This is a little repo where I coded up the ELP.P algorithm to test it out in the optimal tax setting, as well as an idea for a modified ELP.P algorithm that can account work in the setting where which feedback system we observed depends on the action we choose.

Look at the ELP.P repo first then the mod ELP.P repo.
